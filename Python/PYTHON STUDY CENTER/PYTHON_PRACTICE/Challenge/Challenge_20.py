# Consecutive zeros
# The goal of this challenge is to analyze a binary string consisting of only zeros
# and ones. Your code should find the biggest number of consecutive zeros in the string. For example, given the string:

str="100110100000110"
binary_number=str.split("1")
print(len(max(binary_number)))
